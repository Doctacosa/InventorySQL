# InventorySQL

InventorySQL is a Bukkit plugin that saves and restores Minecraft players' inventories to a MySQL database. Its main use is to allow players to carry their inventory between multiple servers linked by BungeeCord.

This fork updates the original plugin to be compatible with recent Spigot releases. Supports 1.14 at the time of writing.
